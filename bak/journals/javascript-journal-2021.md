## React Journal 2021

#### [Prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)

**Story**

I was reviewing authentication patterns this weekend. In the DigitalOcean tutorial they used `propTypes`. I have seen this used a few times before but as it was not my focus at the time I brushed over the significance. This weekend I felt I had the band width to ask "what is this".

**Take Away**

Popping over to the package github page, my take away is that it is another layer of validation, another gatekeeper to catch bugs early and often. I maybe misunderstanding but I think this falls into the same bucket of appeal as TypeScript... But, I will need to do another exploratory pass to speech more definitively on this.
