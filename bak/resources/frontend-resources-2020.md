## About

In the spirit of the internet I am going to try and keep an open post with some of the more notable Frontend resources I have found or have been using in 2020.

### Production Tools

**[ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/)**
Secure custom emails forwarding freemium!

**[Meta Tags](https://metatags.io/)**
Check and edit open graph images, descriptions!

**[Is My Host fast](https://ismyhostfastyet.com/)**
I know once I deploy my site I tend to be onto the next thing. This is a nice little at a glance to make sure I'm not missing to the boat as far as hosting is concerned.

## Code

**[Gitingnore](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)**
Generates you Gitignore file. I dig the idea but haven't incorporated it into the workflow completely. I still pop over to my favorite gitignore list repo.

### JS

**[Does it Mutate](https://doesitmutate.xyz/)**
I enjoyed this because it's always a toggle to [Devdoc.io](https://devdocs.io/) for me to what is "actually" happening when transforming objects in JavaScript.

**[Single line JS Utilities](https://1loc.dev/)**
I always love projects like this.

### React Hooks

**[React Hooks Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/)**
An amazing little library to handle forms in React 16> and they have great documentation and an attentive community.

I have been trying to use BEM a lot more in 2020 and found this little guy to help me out.

**[CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/)**
Not sure if I will ever use this, but I thought it was cool.

**[CssButtons](https://cssbuttons.vercel.app/)**
An amazing library of buttons from simple to very fancy and the necessary CSS to get them in a project :flash

**[css2JS](https://css2js.dotenv.dev/)**
I haven't converted yet but we'll see.

### Tools

I think this is an amazing idea and would love to give it a try.

## Other

It makes svg blobs lol. When I found this I never thought I would use it then about a week later it came in handy. What do you know...
