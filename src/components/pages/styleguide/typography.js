        It's often said that the internet has democratized education: the sum of
        human knowledge is only a Google search away! And yet, having access to
        information is only half of the story; you also need to be able to
        convert raw information into usable skills.

        For a lot of us, the gap between the two can lead to things like
        tutorial hellâ€”getting stuck doing tutorial after tutorial without ever
        feeling like you're making substantive progress.

        Learning how to learn effectively is super important, especially as a
        software developer; learning new things is practically the whole gig! If
        you can learn to quickly pick up new languages/frameworks/tools, you'll
        be able to be way more productive than the average developer. It's sort
        of a superpower.

        you how I pick up new skills lickety-split!
