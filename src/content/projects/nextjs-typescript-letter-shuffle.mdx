## Summary

<Heading as="div" variant="sec" size="md">
  This little project was a "build something" with TypeScript, Next.js, and
  Chakra. The reason for this is no matter how many "getting starter projects"
  you spin up until you build and deploy an idea, no matter how trivial there is
  always a fair amount of unknown complexity.
</Heading>

### Stack

<StackIconsGroup iconArr={["chakraui", "gatsby", "netlify", "github", "mdx"]} />

### Objective

This project is a bit of a meme. I origianlly built a [reorder-string - codepen](https://codepen.io/LucasZapico/pen/wvMqqwO) in 2016 as both a practice project in vanillajs and to solve my lack of ability to come up with "good" usernames.

The resulting shuffler has been my username generater ever since just shuffling my actual name.

#### Features Coverage

From a feature standpoint it's pretty straight forward. Takes in a string and returns a shuffled version of that string.

The project architeture is a nice little boilderpalte with ready to scale support for;

- advanced theming with Chakra-ui
- MDX
- SVG

### Outcome

Produced a unique Gatsby site integrated with Netlify CMS enabling easy
posting. Built a poetry and prose experience in a unique and meaningful
way

### Deliverables

- website
- branding
- design direction
- user experience design
- web design
- development
- email design and automation
