## Summary

<Heading as="div" variant="sec" size="md">
  I realized I don't have many projects on my portfolio that are "really" functionality focused. So I decided to build a little speed math game. The project uses TypeScript, Next.js, and Chakra. The project has some interesting challenges associated with state management so I decided to try out Jotai, React-racker and looked at Context as a solution.
