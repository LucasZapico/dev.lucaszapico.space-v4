### Basics Commands

```sh
> some-command some-option some-arguments
```

### Get manual(documentation) for a given command.

```sh
man <some-command>
```

### Get shell enviroment variables

Environmental
: variables are variables that are defined for the current shell and are inherited by any child shells or processes. Environmental variables are used to pass information into processes that are spawned from the shell.

Shell variables
: are variables that are contained exclusively within the shell in which they were set or defined. They are often used to keep track of ephemeral data, like the current working directory.

```sh
 env
```

### CLI Navigations

```sh
 pwd
 # print working directory
```

```sh
cd
# change directory
```

```sh
cd -
# change to most recent directory
```

### Working with Files

#### Save Result of Command to File

```sh
 'command' /dir > file.txt
 # will save the return of the command to the defined file
```

#### Making Files and Directories

```sh
 touch <my-file>
 # makes a file
```

```sh
 touch {file1,file2,file3}
 touch {01..1000}
 # makes all three defined files
```

```sh
 mkdir <directory-name>/
 # make a folder/directory
```

#### Organizing Files and Directories

```sh
 mv <my-file> <directory-name>/
 # moves my-file to a given directory
```

```sh
 cp <my-file> <directory-copy>/
 # copies given file to defined directory
```

```sh
cp -R /<source_folder> /<destination_folder>
```

```sh
cp -R <source_dir>/ <des_dir>/
# copyies contents of <source_dir> for <des_dir>
```

**Example**

```sh
cp -R ~/Documents ~/Documents-copy
```

```sh
 rm <some-file>
 # removes defined file
```

```sh
 rm -r some-directory
# removes defined directory and all children
```

```sh
 cat some-file
 // returns contents of file
```

```sh
 file some-file.type
 // returns file type
 // example
 file index.html
 return: index.html: ASCII text
```

```sh
vim some-file.type
// opens file in vim for editing
```

```sh
less some-file.type
// opens file in less for editing.
// note: in less 'h' opens up command navigation reference
```

```sh
bg
//(background) sends currently running script to the background
```

```sh
fg
//(foreground) brings scripts running in background to foreground
```

### Functions
