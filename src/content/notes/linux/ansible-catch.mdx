## Init 

Ansible requires a control machine which can then execute Ansible playbooks to provision and setup any machine we can ssh into.

1. ssh into our control machine 


```sh 
pipx install ansible-core 
```

[Alternative install methods](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible-with-pipx)


### Define Host Inventory 

This config defines the machines ansible can interact with and allows for some advanced confiration.

```yml:file=/etc/ansible/hosts.yml
localNetork:
  hosts:
    192.168.1.152:
webservers:
  hosts:
    foo.exmaple.com
```

### Set up Playbooks 

Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, reusable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system, one that is well suited to deploying complex applications.

#### Run shell cmds

[Ansible Sheel Cmd docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html)

```yml:file=playbook.yml
- name: Execute the command in remote shell; stdout goes to the specified file on the remote
  ansible.builtin.shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt

- name: Run a command that uses non-posix shell-isms (in this example /bin/sh doesn't handle redirection and wildcards together but bash does)
  ansible.builtin.shell: cat < /tmp/*txt
  args:
    executable: /bin/bash
```
