## Summary 

As part of setting up my new Ubuntu machine, I've distilled the essential setup steps into a concise summary. This approach will help me document the process for future reference, as some steps may be less well-known or require additional research to replicate. Additionally, this overview will serve as a foundation for when I eventually deploy my Ansible pipeline.

## Basic Configuration

1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt upgrade`
3. `sudo apt install git`
4. `sudo apt install zsh`
5. `sudo apt install tmux`
5. `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`` # Install Oh My Zsh
6. set zsh theme to "awesomepanda" in `~/.zshrc`
7. `export PPROMPT='%(?.%F{green}->.%F{red}->)%f %B%F{yellow}%n@%m::%F{red}%2~%f' in `~/.zshrc`
8. `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` # Install Homebrew
9. `/bin/bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh || curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh)"` # Install Kinto remap keyboard to mac like behavior
10. `sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager`
11. `sudo apt install gnome-tweaks` # Install Gnome Tweaks
12. Gnome Tweaks > Additional Layout Options > Alt and Win behavior > Ctrl is mapped to win and the usual Ctrl # this just makes `cmd + c`, `cmd + t` etc work as expected
13. Gnome Tweaks > Additional Layout Options > Caps Lock behavior > Make Caps Lock and addition Esc # this makes caps lock an additional esc key
14. `sudo apt install gdb` # Install GDB detailed crash reports and debuging
