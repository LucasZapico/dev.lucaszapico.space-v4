## Setting Up Virtual Environment pipenv in VScode Jupyter notebook instance 

1. Open a terminal instance in the project directory 
2. `pipenv shell`
3. `pipenv --venv` to get the path to the virtual environment
3. `cmd + shift + p` to open the command palette
4. Select `Python: Select Interpreter`
5. Select the virtual environment that matches the path from step 3 or add it directly 


## Setting Virtual Env in Vscode Jupyter Notebook 

This is a bit of a pain, as it seems that vscode only supports or detects certain virtual environment paths. In my case my virtual environments were stored in `~/snap/code/179/.local/share/virtualenvs/...` and vscode did not detect them and when setting a virtual env it doesn't let you explicitly set the path.  

### Solution 

Adding the following to my `settings.json` file in vscode allowed me to set the virtual environment path manually.

```json:title="settings.json"
  {
  #.... other settings
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "~/snap/code/179/.local/share/virtualenvs/src-jRrTfxz5",
  }
```
