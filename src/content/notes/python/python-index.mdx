## Cheatsheet

## Helper

From the python CLI env we can use `>>> help()` then a python method or keyword to get the documentation. 

```sh
>>> help()
help> for
# outputs the python documentation for 'for'
```

### `dir(<object>)`

Dir on an object will list out the available methods as a quick reference.
