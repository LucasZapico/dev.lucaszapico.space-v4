## Linting 

### Pylint 

### Vscode 

#### Gotchas

> ⚠️ Pylint vscode extension import errors

 By default the pylint vscode extension is set to a workspace root, so if the project dir is nested pylint will through import errors. To fix this open `./.vscode/settings.json` 

 ```json:file="settings.json"
 {
  //...
  "pylint.cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/algo-trading",
  //...
 }
   
 ```

### Project 

```sh 
pipenv install pylint
```
