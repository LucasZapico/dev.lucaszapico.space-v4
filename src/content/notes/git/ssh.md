# ssh Catch 

## Set-Up

### Single Service

__Generate Key__

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

For a single service use the default file `.ssh/id_rsa` but for multiple services follow the steps below. 

### Setting Up Unique SSH for Multiple Services 

__Make a config__

```shell
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

__Example config__

*config*
```txt
# contents of $HOME/.ssh/config
Host github.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.key
Host gitlab.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab.key
```

Now when `ssh-keygen -t rsa` asks for a file specify the file associated with the domain or service 

__Example key gen__

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <github-email>
```

```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/lkuno/.ssh/id_ed25519): github.key
```

>ðŸ’¡  note: if the file does not show up in `.ssh/` using the full path should correct


### Add to Service 
> ðŸ”¥ make sure to use the `.pub` extension as this is where our public key is stored

```shell 
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github.key.pub
```

Add this to the services we want to Authorize.
