## SSH Reference

- creating keys 
- common errors
- ssh between machines 
- handling ssh with git and different accounts 

ssh into remote server

```sh
ssh <remote-username>@<remote_domain/ip>
```

**Examples**

```sh
ssh root@216.125.129.17
```

If a ssh key pair is found a new session will start. If not and the machine allows ssh access via user name and password a prompt for password will occur. 

### Move File or Directories between Machines 

```sh 
scp <source> <destination>
```
#### Files 

```sh
scp /path/to/file username@:host/path/to/destination
```

```sh
scp username@host:/path/to/file /path/to/destination
```

**Example** 

```sh 
scp foo@193.169.1.215:~/foo ~/foo 
```

#### Dir 

```sh
scp -r /path/to/dir username@:host/path/to/destination
```

```sh
scp -r username@host:/path/to/dir /path/to/destination
```

## Set-Up ssh Access

### Generate Key

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

_Github Example_

```shell
 ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

For a single service use the default file `.ssh/id_rsa` but for multiple services follow the steps below.

### Copy SSh key to remote machine

```sh
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<name-public-key>.pub <server_user_name>@<ip_add_server>
```


### Setting Up Unique SSH for Multiple Services

**Make a config**

```shell
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

**Example config**

_config_

```txt
# contents of $HOME/.ssh/config
Host github.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.key
Host gitlab.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab.key
```

Now when `ssh-keygen -t rsa` asks for a file specify the file associated with the domain or service

**Example key gen**

```shell
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/<foo>/.ssh/id_ed25519): github.key
```

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <github-email>
```

> ðŸ’¡ note: if the file does not show up in `.ssh/` using the full path should correct

### Add Host to known Hosts

**ssh auth Error**

```shell
"The authenticity of host '216.128.129.16 (216.128.129.16)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:nnzspBxbguoVHYiPiPEL6smGCfyE2KRSMLmayeaH3Mw.
This key is not known by any other names"
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
```

```shell
ssh-keyscan -H <ip.address> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Add to Service

> ðŸ”¥ make sure to use the `.pub` extension as this is where our public key is stored

```shell
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github.key.pub
```

Add this to the services we want to Authorize.

## Testing and Troubleshooting Connections

Test ssh connection

```shell
ssh -T git@github.com
```

```shell
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Verbose tst

```shell
ssh -Tv git@github.com
```

We can also test a specific host from out `~/.ssh/config`

## Use with Github, BitBucket, Gitlab etc

### Cloning a new project

Clone repos with the host name declared in ssh config ðŸ‘‡

```sh
git clone git@work:username/my-work-project.git
git clone git@personal:username/my-personal-project.git
```

For reference, this is the default behavior

```sh
git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/my-work-project.git
git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/my-personal-project.git
```

### Updating and existing repo

To update and existing repo to push to a specific github account/profile. Navigate to the project `.git/config` and add the `Host` from `.ssh/config` as the host in the ssh url.

**Example**

_.git/config_

```txt
...
[remote "origin"]
   url = git@work-profile:username/work-project-two.git

...
```

## SSH Between Two Mac on LAN

### Common Friction Points

You can try the following but it can fail `Full Disk Access privileges.` error.

```sh
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on
```

If ðŸ‘†that doesn't work try ðŸ‘‡

```sh
## Enabling SSH
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
```

to turn remote access off as a security best practice.

```sh
## Disabling SSH
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
```

### Check Status

```sh
# To check if is on or off
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
```
