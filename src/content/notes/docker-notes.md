## Common Commands

### Containers

```shell
docker run node
```

Runs and instance of an image. If the image does not exist docker will pull an instance

```shell
docker ps
```

List running containers and basic information

```shell
docker ps -a
```

List containers both running or stopped and basic information

```shell
docker stop silly_sammet
```

Stops a running container

```shell
docker rm silly_sammet
```

Remove a stopped container run `docker ps -a` to confirm removal

```shell
docker run -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

Runs docker in the foreground

```shell
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

the `-d` flag will run docker in the background

```shell
docker attach <id>
```

or

```shell
docker attach <name>
```

##### Interactive Terminal

By default docker containers do not accept inputs through the terminal to enable this use the `-it` flag for interactive terminal

```shell
docker run -it
```

##### Port Mapping

```shell
docker
```

#### Tags

```shell
docker run node:12
```

A tag is a flag to specify a particular flavor of an image, the command without a tag will default to `latest`

### Images

```shell
docker images
```

Shows a list of images

```shell
docker rmi node
```

removes an image Note: the image cannot be in use by any container

```shell
docker run node
```

Runs and image if the image already exists on machine else pulls latest image and runs.

#### Run Container

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000/tcp <imageName>
```

```shell
docker pull node
```

Pulls an instance of an image

> Containers only run as log as the process they contain is running is live, such as a database or web service.

#### Build Image

```shell
docker build .
```

or

```shell
docker build ./path/to/dir
```

or **best practice** tag your image with a name

```shell
docker build . -t imageName
```
