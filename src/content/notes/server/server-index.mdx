This is a general note catch for server setup, configuration and security best practices.

Server configuration has a fair over lap with ssh and general Linux commands. Because of this overlap some content may be referenced only.

## Configring A New Server Checklist

- [ ] add new admin
- [ ] disable root admin
- [ ] ssh

### Security Hardening

- [ ] disable password login
- [ ] change ssh port

## Access Remote Server

```
ssh -v user@IP-Address
```

## Adding Users, Passwords and Groups via ClI

### Add User

```sh
useradd <new-username>
```

```sh
id <new-username>
```

#### Add Password to User

```sh
sudo passwd <new-username>
# props for password and password confirmation
```

#### Add User to Group

```sh
sudo usermod -aG <group> <user-name>
```

#### Add User to Group

```sh
sudo usermod -d  <user-name> <group>
```

#### Delete User Group

```sh
sudo groupdel <group>
```

> ðŸš¨ security, when configuring a new server setup ssh first add a new admin and disable the root user and password login

### Role Naming Convention

> ðŸ’¡ The naming conventions are just general options. Also note that by using one of these hackers have a known vector to brut force a server.

`<auth-level>.<firstname>.<surname>@<domain>`

#### Option One

```txt
EA-first.last # Enterprise Admin.

DA-first.last # Domain Admin.

SA-first.last # Server Admin.

WA-first.last # Workstation Admin.

First.last # user level.
```

#### Option Two

```txt
Tier One (Domain Admin): t1.username

Tier Two (Server-Only Admin): t2.username

Tier Three (Workstation-Only Admin): t3.username

(standard daily-driver): username
```
