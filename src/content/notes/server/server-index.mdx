This is a general note catch for server setup, configuration and security best practices.

Server configuration has a fair over lap with ssh and general Linux commands. Because of this overlap some content may be referenced only. 

[ssh notes](/notes/ssh-catch)



## Access Remote Server 

```
ssh -v user@IP-Address
```

## Adding Users, Passwords and Groups via ClI

### Add User

```sh
useradd <new-username>
```

#### Add Password to User 

```sh 
sudo passwd <new-username>
# props for password and password confirmation
```



> ‼️ \#security when configuring a new server first add a new admin and disable the root user. 

### Role Naming Convention 

> 💡 The naming conventions are just general options. Also note that by using one of these hackers have a known vector to brut force a server. 

`<auth-level>.<firstname>.<surname>@<domain>`

#### Option One

```txt
EA-first.last # Enterprise Admin.

DA-first.last # Domain Admin.

SA-first.last # Server Admin.

WA-first.last # Workstation Admin.

First.last # user level.
```

#### Option Two 

```txt
Tier One (Domain Admin): t1.username

Tier Two (Server-Only Admin): t2.username

Tier Three (Workstation-Only Admin): t3.username

(standard daily-driver): username
```



## New Server Checklist 

- [ ] add new admin 
- [ ] disable root admin
