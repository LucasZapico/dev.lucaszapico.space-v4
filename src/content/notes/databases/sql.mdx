## Notes and Reference SQL Language

### SQL Categories

DML
:Data Manipulation Language

DDL
:Data Definition language

#### DBMS Database Management System

- oracle

### Quick Reference

> ðŸ“’ Note SQL is not case sensitive but it is general practice to distinguish fields

- not case sensitive
- not white space sensitive
- not semi collen sensitive (officially it should)

Though the addition of each of these formats are best practice and general convention.

### Important

- **String values in SQL are surrounded in single quotes**
- **equality is a single =**

#### Select statement

```SQL
SELECT * FROM table;
-- returns all columns from some table

SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition
-- returns all columns from some table where a condition is met

SELECT * FROM database.table WHERE condition
-- in some cases the database needs to be specified, though many SQL databases server have default databases that a query will be aplied to
```

Examples Select:

```SQL
SELECT FirstName FROM Employee;
-- returns Firstname column from employee

SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employee;
-- returns 2 columns FirstName and LastName

SELECT *  FROM Employee;
-- returns all columns from employee table

SELECT *  FROM Employee WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
-- returns all columns where lastname is equal to Smith
```

#### Insert Statement

```SQL
INSERT INTO table (a,b,c)
  VALUES (1,2,3)
  ORDER BY b;
```

#### Update Statement

```SQL
UPDATE table SET a = 7, b =5;
```

#### Delete Statement

```SQL
DELETE FROM table WHERE a = 7;
```

#### Record match query

```SQL
SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM table;
```

#### Where

```SQL

```
