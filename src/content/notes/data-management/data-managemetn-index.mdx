## Introduction 

This note is meant to be a reference for data management processes and what I have come to deem as best practices.

### Thoughts on Consumer Cloud Storage Solutions

At this point I am disenfranchised with cloud storage solutions such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. I have found that they are slow and do not function as expected. The main sticking point is that they are black boxe solutions and the assumptions built into them are unknown to the end user and only by falling into an unexpected use case do we learn that something wasn't taken into account. 

As a little aside, I also feel that the cloud storage solutions for the big names were money grabs when there was a lot of momentum around the idea and many of the consumer products are poorly maintained and sitting in a dusty corner of the company's portfolio.

The final mark against cloud solutions beyond the fact that we are trusting our data to third parties that do not have our best interests at heart is that [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) and [rclone](https://rclone.org/) are Open Source, fully customizable solutions that have been around for a long time and are well maintained. Which with a little due diligence and maintaince we can be much more confident in our personal data managment. can be trusted to be secure and reliable.
