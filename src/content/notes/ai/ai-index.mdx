### Using Copilot to help me write OpenAPI documentaiton for API 

I was able to give the Copilot my list of endpoint and it was able to generate a substantial amount of the OpenAPI documentation for me. 

> note: I had been "talking"  with it and using it to check and stub out quit of few endpoints before I just dumpped my list of endpoints on it. So I'm not sure how well it would do with out some context to reference.

### Working with Ollama Locally 


#### Linux 

```sh 
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh 
```

#### Mac 

> Note: I ran this on a mac using the build in GPU so it was a pretty slow  

[Download](https://ollama.com/download/Ollama-darwin.zip)

1. unzip the file 
2. move to `/Applications/`


Check that Ollama is running;

1. Go to browers by going to `http://localhost:11434`
2. `curl http://localhost:11434` or `http http://localhost:11434` 

#### Install Models 

```sh 
ollama pull llama3.1

```sh 
ollama pull llama2
```

### Set Up Open Web UI  

Open Web Ui is a web interface for that is easy to set up with Ollama or OpenAI that gives us the expected GUI experience to interact with an AI model.

[Official Open Web UI docs](https://docs.openwebui.com/)

### My Docker Compose Recipe 

[OpenWebUI Docker Compose Recipe - github LucasZapico](https://github.com/LucasZapico/docker-recipes/blob/master/ml-ai/openwebui.docker-compose.yml)

#### Set up Open Web Ui as "Desktop" App 

Despite my general adversion to big tech tools Chromes feature to create a desktop app really shines to create a better experience here.

### Robust Use of Personal Data Sets 

Open web UI allows us to add file individually for the model to reference and interact with. But I have a relatively large body of personal notes that I wanted to be priortized and drawn from. 

Open Web UI allows for directories to be added to the model by mounting the directory into our Docekr Image `{DIR_PATH}:/app/backend/data/docs`


#### Mount Custom Data Set 

```sh 
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -v <path/to/data>:/app/backend/data/docs --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```
