## Asynchronous Code

To understand the challenges or problems that asynchronous code solves let's put forward the following abstract example. Suppose we have a long-running function "alpha" in a synchronous program. Such that any functions following alpha will not execute until alpha is completed. One of the most obvious challenges this causes is apparent in the case of user input, the on-click events attached to a button or input would not be "listened for" because the program is handling alpha.

The problems asynchrouns code solves are;

1. Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
2. Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that our program can still be responsive to other events.
3. Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes.

#### setTimeout

A function that asynchronously invokes a callback after a delay in milliseconds
**Simple Example 1**

```JavaScript
// setTimeout usage
function callback() {
  console.log("callback function");
}
var delay = 1000; // Delay is in ms
setTimeout(callback, delay);
```

**Simple Example - anonymous function**

```JavaScript
setTimeout(function(){
  console.log("Runs in approx. 2000ms");
  }, 2000);
```

#### setInterval

**Simple Example 1**

```JavaScript
// setInterval usage
function callback() {
  console.log("callback is called continuously");
}
var repeat = 3000;
setTimeout(callback, repeat);
```

**Simple Example - anonymous function**

```JavaScript
var num = 0;
setInterval(function(){
  num++;
  console.log("num:", num);
}, 1000);
```

**Simple Example - cancel interval**

```JavaScript
var num = 0;
var intervalId = setInterval(function() {
  num++;
  console.log("num", num);
  if(num === 3){
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  }
}, 1000);
```
