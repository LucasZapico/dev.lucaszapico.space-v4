Markdown also integrates seamlessly with most if not all programing languages thereby enhabling transforming, sorting, and search etc in a much more straight forward way compared to traditional wysiwyg editors such as word, paper, and gdocs.

## Markdown Tool and Apps

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Obsidian has gained a huge following since 2022 after it's initial lunch in 2020. It is considered a knowleged base tool or "second brain" with many features and plugins enhabiling organizing data and the relationships between.

> Obsidian has a decent plugin ecosystem and leans heavily to individual knowlege indexing.

Note: Though Obsidian sits on the file system it leverages a `.obsidian` directory to manage plugin configs and states, which can cause issue when used in a development pipeline.

_I personaly ran into some complexity layering it on top of a Gatsby development workflow with managing the content. I suspect there is a workaround but it was not a priority._
