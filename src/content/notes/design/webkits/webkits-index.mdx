## Components 

### Cards 

Cards are a high-level ui element used to visually separate content. Cards can be broken into two categories, interactive and static. Interactive cards are used to move users to other pages of an app. This is normally visually identified but a hover, focus effect to indicate intractability. Static cards are leveraged to group content that has similar intent of focus.

### Card Design Convention 

To keep a design consistent and organized a good practice is to start with a single card base where border, border-radius, and shadow are decided for example. From this base create profile, article, metric, and link cards, etc. 

> Card design is a gross offender where designers without strong processes and guard rails around their design system can make small changes to card design over the lifetime of a project that ends up with gross inconsistency. 


### Interactive Cards 

A convention for interactive cards is to use border or shadow to show a z-axis separation from the rest of the content flow. 

> This is by no means a hard rule as designers are constantly coming up with new and creative ways to convey a visual message.
