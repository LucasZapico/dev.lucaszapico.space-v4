### Rebuild image after adding new npm package to project

```
docker compose build
```

## Docker Compose Volumes 

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è gotcha: use explicit paths, `/home/foo/<path-to-dir>` rather than üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `~/<path-to-dir>` or `${HOME}/<path-to-dr>`. There might be a way to do this but it was not obvious with my research pass

```docker.compose 
version: "3"
services:
	foo:
		volumes: 
			- ./bar:/app/bar
```

#### Refreshing Persistent Volumes

Delete the volume between runs with 
```
docker-compose down --volumes
```

### Handling Docker Files in Project Subdirectory 

- [docker using copy  when dockerfile is in subdirectory  - stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47785706/docker-using-copy-when-the-dockerfile-is-located-in-a-subdirectory)

Suppose the following directory structure, to support a nested structure some extra configuration is required. 

```txt
|-src/
	|-docker/
		|-Dockerfile.development
		|-docker-compose.development.yml
```


I found that handling the concern in the docker-compose file seems to be the most straightforward. This can be done by adding; 

```yml:title="docker-compose.development.yml"
# ...
		build:
			context: .. # path to root
			dockerfile: ./docker/Dockerfile.development # path to docker file from root
# ...
```

## Docker Compose Command Reference 

```sh 
# docker compose --env-file <path/to/env> --file <path/to/compose> up
docker compose --env-file .env.production --file docker-compose.production.yml up

# up detach 
docker compose --env-file .env.development --file docker-compose.development.yml up -d

# build
docker compose --env-file ./env/.env.development --file ./docker/docker-compose.development.yml up --build

# build detached 
docker compose --env-file ./env/.env.development --file ./docker/docker-compose.development.yml up --build -d
```
