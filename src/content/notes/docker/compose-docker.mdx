## Running Services Individually 

[Running Single Services Docker Compose Reference ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_run/#description)

> Gotcha ðŸ§¶ , the mapped ports in the docker compose file are ignored 

The port mapping defined in the docker compose file are ignored when running services individually. The docker team's reason for this is to avoid conflicts with a running service. 
Personally, I disagree with this design decision and when handling this for the first time I spent a fair amount of time trying to pin down why my service wasn't mapping out of my container. 

```sh
docker compose --file <path-to-compose> run -p <external-port>:<internal-port> <service-name-in-compose>  
```
