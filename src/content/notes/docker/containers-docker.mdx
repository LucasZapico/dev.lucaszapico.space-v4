## Container Management

> ðŸ’¡ By default, `docker run` or `docker create` do not make Docker ports accessible by services in the outside world. The port publish command need to be used to make an app accessible

### `create` vs `run` vs `start` 

`run` 
: The run command is both `create` and `start` commands. It is used to expedite creating a new container. 
: `docker run --name <container-name> -it -p <external-port>:<internal-port> <image-name>`

`create`
: The create command creates a new container from an image but does not start it. 
: `docker create --name <container-name> -p <external-port>:<internal-port> <image-name>` 
- `start` starts and already existing container 

### Create Container 

[docker create cli docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create/)

The following is simple example that assumes configuration in a dockerfile. 

```sh 
docker create --name <new-container-name> -p <external-port>:<internal-port>
```

### Start Container 

```sh
docker start <container-name>
```


**Example**

```sh 
docker run app-foo
```

#### Start Container With Active Terminal 


```sh 
docker run -it <image-name>
```

```sh 
docker run -it app-foo
```

#### Start Container with Bash 

```sh 
docker run -ti <image-name> /bin/bash
```
