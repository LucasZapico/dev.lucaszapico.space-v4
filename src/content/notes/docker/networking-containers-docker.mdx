Networking containers enable a containerized app to communicate with the outside world. In many cases a given app may be dependent on a database or multiple services. We can "expose" to enable these interactions.

## Expose 

### Dockerfile 


```dockerfile:title=dockerfile
...
EXPOSE 8080 
...
```

We can also expose multiple ports 

```dockerfile:title=dockerfile
...
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 8080 
EXPOSE 5432
...
```



### CLI and Run Time 

#### At `docker start` 

#### At `docker run` 

```sh 
docker run --expose=8080 --name="port-demo" test
```

### Troubleshooting 


```sh
grep -w <port>/tcp' /etc/services
```
