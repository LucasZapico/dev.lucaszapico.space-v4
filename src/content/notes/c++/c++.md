# Notes for C++ Programing

---

##### General Doc Information

**Initial Entry </br> Date: 2017.October.16th**</br>

I have begun exploring C++ with the goal of developing a strong foundation in code programming concepts.</br> </br>

_WHY ::_</br>
I initially attacked the development space with javaScript as my phylinx. But, I have now called into question whether or it is the best median for understanding of core concepts that I have begun to run into as I have explored the space further. Therefore, I have decided to mirror to a degree the current method of learning core concepts. Hence the beginning of this journal.

> _note: At this point I am not convinced this was the wrong approch. Though, at this point there is enough reason to explore the benefits of learning c++_

As I have been exploring the software development space
I will not go into the reasons behind my desire to be a proficient programer here.

#### C++ Basics

C++ fully supports the four pillars of object oriented development

- encapsulation
- data hiding
- inheritance
- polymorphism

**ANSI** :: this standard ensures C++ complies without error on Mac, UNIX, Windows and Alpha</br>

---

#### Syntax

- **object** - objects have states and behaviors. An object is a instance of a class.
  - Example: A dog has a state - color, name, breed and behaviors - wagging, barking, eating.
- **class** - a class is a a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states
- **methods** - a method is a behavior. Classes can contain methods. Logic and data manipulation and actions are executed.
- **instance variables** - an objects state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

###### Semicolons and Blocks C++

A logical entity in C++ must end with a semicolon. The semicolon is a statement terminator.

```
int x = 5;
int y = x + 4;
int add( x, y){
  return  x + y;
};
```

#### Data-types

<<---- Data-types & memory allocation --->>
<<---- chars and their numeric values --->>
<<---- implicit and explicit conversion --->

//static cast

```
//static cast
int num1 = 5 + static_cast<int>(12.75);
double num1 = static_cast<double>(5) + 12.75;
char x = static_cast<char>(65);

```
