## Error Handling In Go Lang 

### `panic` 

A `panic` is a runtime exception that's raised when the program encounters an error it can't handle, such as a divide-by-zero operation or an attempt to access an out-of-bounds array index. When a panic occurs, the program will stop executing and print an error message before exiting.

When a panic occurs, the Go runtime will automatically call the `recover()` function on every deferred function until one of them calls defer return. If no deferred functions are found, the panic is re-raised. Otherwise, the panic is propagated up the call stack until it's caught by the main goroutine.

#### Simple Example 

```go 
func divide(x int, y int) {
    if y == 0 {
        panic("division by zero!")
    }
    return x / y
}

func main() {
    defer func() { fmt.Println("Panic recovered!") }()
    result := divide(10, 0)
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

In this example, the `divide` function panics when `y` is zero. The `defer` statement will catch the panic and print "Panic recovered!" to the console.
