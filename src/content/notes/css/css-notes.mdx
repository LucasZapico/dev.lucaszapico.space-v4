## Accessibility Best Practices

**SASS**

Some browsers do not support em's, therefore it is a good practice to use some sort of mixen to convert em's to px"

```css
// Rem output with px fallback
@mixin font-size($sizeValue: 1) {
  font-size: ($sizeValue * 16) * 1px;
  font-size: $sizeValue * 1rem;
}
```

## Quick Reference

 {
  object-fit: fill;
  object-fit: contain;
  object-fit: cover;
