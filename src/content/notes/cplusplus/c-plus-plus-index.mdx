## Dev Log - 2017 TL:DR

I have begun exploring C++ with the goal of developing a strong foundation in code programming concepts.
 
I initially attacked the development space with javaScript as my phylinx. But, I have now called into question whether or it is the best median for understanding of core concepts that I have begun to run into as I have explored the space further. Therefore, I have decided to mirror to a degree the current method of learning core concepts. Hence the beginning of this journal.

> note: At this point I am not convinced this was the wrong approch. Though, at this point there is enough reason to explore the benefits of learning c++

As I have been exploring the software development space
I will not go into the reasons behind my desire to be a proficient programer here.


## Notes

### C++ Basics

C++ fully supports the four pillars of object oriented development

- encapsulation
- data hiding
- inheritance
- polymorphism

ANSI 
: this standard ensures C++ complies without error on Mac, UNIX, Windows and Alpha



### Syntax

object
: objects have states and behaviors. An object is a instance of a class.
: Example: A dog has a state - color, name, breed and behaviors - wagging, barking, eating.

class
: a class is a a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states

methods
: a method is a behavior. Classes can contain methods. Logic and data manipulation and actions are executed.

instance variables
: an objects state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

#### Semicolons and Blocks C++

A logical entity in C++ must end with a semicolon. The semicolon is a statement terminator.

```c++
int x = 5;
int y = x + 4;
int add( x, y){
  return  x + y;
};
```

| double       | mutable   | switch           | while    |
| dynamic_cast | namespace | template         |



#### Data-types

Data-types & memory allocation
chars and their numeric values
implicit and explicit conversion



```c++
//static cast
int num1 = 5 + static_cast<int>(12.75);
double num1 = static_cast<double>(5) + 12.75;
char x = static_cast<char>(65);

```
