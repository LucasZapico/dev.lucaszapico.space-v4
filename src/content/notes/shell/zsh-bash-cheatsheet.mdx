I was originally going to make this a Zsh cheatsheet but because of the amount of cross over it would be easier to just callout inline where their is a divergence. 

## Basics

The most basic of any language, framework tool or systems is knowing where to go to find answers. `man` is the manual for the terminal but it can be a little intimidating and just overall a little much. So I have added a few alternatives

```sh 
man head
```

### `tldr`

`tldr` which is a community driven man alterative. `brew install tldr` 

```sh 
tldr head
```


### `cheat.sh` 

This is a slick project, `curl` or `httpie` can be used to access the and it return a simple and easy to read cheatsheet.

```sh 
curl cheat.sh/head
```
or 

`brew install httpie`

```sh 
http cheat.sh/head
```



From within a CLI(command line interface) environment**Echo**


### Basic Structure 

```sh
> some-command some-option some-arguments
```

### Get manual(documentation) for a given command.

```sh
man <some-command>
```

### Print to Terminal

```sh:title=shell
echo "some text"
```

```sh:title=shell
echo "1\t2\t3"
1\t2\t3

echo -e "1\t2\t3"
1	2	3
```

## Conditionals 

```sh
######### 1)
if expression 
then 
  # do something
fi

######## 2)
if expression; then
    # instructions
fi

######## 3)
if expression; then ...; fi

######## 4)
if expression; then
    # instructions
else
    # instructions
fi

######## 5)
if expression; then
    # instructions
elif expression
    # instructions
else
    # instructions
fi
```

## Loop 

### Basic Loops

```sh 
# 1)
for itervarname in iterable
do
    # instructions
done

# 2)
for itervarname in iterable; do
    # instructions
done

# 3)
for itervaname in iterable; do ...; done
```

## function 

```sh 
foo() {
  echo "Foo rules the world"
}
# call function
foo
```

### Common Loops


```sh 
FOO_ARR=(foo bar baz)
# loop through and array 
for i in ${FOO_ARR[@]}; do
  echo $i
done
```

### Styling CLI

### Text Color Codes

|  color  | code  |
| :-----: | :---: |
|  Reset  |   0   |
|  black  |  30   |
|   red   |  31   |
|  green  |  32   |
| yellow  |  33   |
|  blue   |  34   |
| magenta |  35   |
|  cyan   |  36   |
|  white  |  37   |

**Example - Print out blue text**

```sh
echo -e "\e[1;34m This is blue text \e[0m"
 This is blue text
```

### Background Color Codes

| color   | code |
| :------ | :--- |
| Reset   | 0    |
| black   | 40   |
| red     | 41   |
| green   | 42   |
| yellow  | 43   |
| blue    | 44   |
| magenta | 45   |
| cyan    | 46   |
| white   | 47   |

```sh
echo -e "\e[1;43m This is text has a yellow background \e[0m"
 This text has a yellow background
```



### Get shell environment variables

Environmental
: variables are variables that are defined for the current shell and are inherited by any child shells or processes. Environmental variables are used to pass information into processes that are spawned from the shell.

Shell variables
: are variables that are contained exclusively within the shell in which they were set or defined. They are often used to keep track of ephemeral data, like the current working directory.

```sh
 env
```

### CLI Navigation

```sh
 pwd
 # print working directory
```

```sh
cd
# change directory
```

```sh
cd -
# change to most recent directory
```

## Working with Files

### Save Result of Command to File

```sh
 'command' /dir > file.txt
 # will save the return of the command to the defined file
```

### Making Files and Directories

```sh
 touch <my-file>
 # makes a file
```

```sh
 touch {file1,file2,file3}
 touch {01..1000}
 # makes all three defined files
```

```sh
 mkdir <directory-name>/
 # make a folder/directory
```

### Organizing Files and Directories

```sh
 mv <my-file> <directory-name>/
 # moves my-file to a given directory
```

```sh
 cp <my-file> <directory-copy>/
 # copies given file to defined directory
```

```sh
cp -R /<source_folder> /<destination_folder>
```

```sh
cp -R <source_dir>/ <des_dir>/
# copyies contents of <source_dir> for <des_dir>
```

**Example**

```sh
cp -R ~/Documents ~/Documents-copy
```

```sh
 rm <some-file>
 # removes defined file
```

```sh
 rm -r some-directory
# removes defined directory and all children
```

```sh
 cat some-file
 // returns contents of file
```

```sh
 file some-file.type
 // returns file type
 // example
 file index.html
 return: index.html: ASCII text
```

```sh
vim some-file.type
// opens file in vim for editing
```

```sh
less some-file.type
// opens file in less for editing.
// note: in less 'h' opens up command navigation reference
```

```sh
bg
//(background) sends currently running script to the background
```

```sh
fg
//(foreground) brings scripts running in background to foreground
```


### Functions 

```sh

```

## Bash

**Echo**

```sh
~ echo "some text"
// prints some text to the terminal
```

### `which`

```sh
which some-command
// file path to command
```


### Network Status Commands

```
netstat -ap tcp | grep -i "LISTEN"
//

netstat -ap tcp
//

sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
//

sudo lsof -PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
//command/app, PID, user, FD, TYPE, DEVICE, SIZE, NODE, NAME(PORT)

lsof -i tcp:<port>
//command/app, PID, user, FD, TYPE, DEVICE, SIZE, NODE, NAME(defined-PORT)

kill -9 <PID>
//kill by process ID

```

### Foo Reference 

I just wanted to jot this down for future reference. Shell scripting languages don't have the concept of a class or object, but you can use associative arrays to create a similar structure. Here are example in bash and zsh of how you can use associative arrays to create a "person" object with properties like name, age, and city:

Interesting stuff, but I think running into a need like this, it would be better to use python or golang. 

```bash  
# Declare an associative array
declare -A person

# Add properties to the associative array
person[name]="John Doe"
person[age]=30
person[city]="New York"

# Access properties
echo "Name: ${person[name]}"
echo "Age: ${person[age]}"
echo "City: ${person[city]}"
```

```zsh 
# Declare an associative array
typeset -A person

# Add properties to the associative array
person[name]="John Doe"
person[age]=30
person[city]="New York"

# Access properties
echo "Name: ${person[name]}"
echo "Age: ${person[age]}"
echo "City: ${person[city]}"
```
