## Quality of Life 

### Reload Config after changes without closing terminal 

```sh 
source ~/.bashrc # or .zshrc


```

### Custom Prompts 

In your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file you can add custom prompts to your terminal. 

```txt:title=".bashrc"
PROMPT="%(?.%F{green}->.%F{red}->)%f %B%F%n@%m-%1~%f%b "
```

This results as a prompt that looks like this: 

```sh
-> user@hostname-<parentofcurrentdir>
```
