## What are Programing Paradigms

Programing paradigms are the various infrastructure patterns.

## Functional

Organize our code as pure functions and we pass our data around as parameters.

## Object-Oriented

Everything is ordered as an object and classes
Data is stored in properties of objects
Functions are stored as methods of objects

The application is broken up into its parts and each of these is a class or objects

## Procedural

## Examples

```javascript
const
```
