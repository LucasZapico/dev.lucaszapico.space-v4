## Bug 

I just want to log for my own reference this bug as I have now tackle it twice and had to go through the googlefoo to find the answer again.

At a high level there seems to be some challenge with how some packages are handled in the server side rendering of Vite. In my case the package `react-use` introduced me to the issue.

On the client react give you this error üëáÔ∏è

```
Named export 'useCopyToClipboard' not found. The requested module 'react-use' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:
```

On the server side the error is üëáÔ∏è

```
[vite] Internal server error: [vite] Named export 'useCopyToClipboard' not found. The requested module 'react-use' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:

import pkg from 'react-use';
const {useCopyToClipboard} = pkg;
```

The solutions that is suggested in the error did not work. 

The solution that worked for me was to add the following to the `vite.config.js` file

```
 ssr: {
    noExternal: ["react-use"],
  },

  ```
