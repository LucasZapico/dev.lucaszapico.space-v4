## Gotchas 

### Animate Progress Bar 

The [progress bar](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/progress/props) component doesn't go into how to animate it and after a little digging this hack was discovered. 

```js
// ....
  <Progress
        value={progress}
        sx={{ '>[role="progressbar"]': { transition: "width 200ms ease-out" } }}
      />
// ....
```
