So I'm just gonna jump down the high-level reasons but crafting why I am leaving Gatsby or next first let's say start with some of the benefits of Gatsby kind of what I'm looking for when I'm working on the framework so obviously one of the major draws Gatsby is out of the box handling routing really clean ways of dealing with content markdown MDX integrating craft you'll make it really easy to work with different Contin sources on all the things are really as all of the performance dimension of Gatsby and just how fast it is when it's with because the fact that it's not excite excite all the continents Street in sumo so these are all things that are kind of on the top my head without going down the list the benefits and why I like Gatsby also just kind of powder everything's organized from Stretchberry standpoint mix gas be relatively easy to work with especially verse building something from scratch and making all those design assistance from scratch architectural decisions so now the points.

 why I'm leaving Gatsby it really just comes down to local development experience the fact When I have messages recently is that it's just really slow I've been building things next little bit here and there just a retool her to stay on top of my tooling and there's a huge difference from making a change with Gatsby and letting it rebuild and next 30 days seconds two full minute for when you're making changes and I just it's just a lot of that time it really really does Anna and I am you know I just don't have the time and I'm for my personal projects and things like that I'm able to make the decision without major consequences of whether or not I Wanna work with him yes it is a bummer cause I've been using Gatsby for three or four years now it's been a great tool and I made lotta projects with it but I I just can't it just takes too long compared to some of the more modern satisfy generators and build tools and that that stuff just adds up over the course of a project I've been editing my own personal portfolio recently and it's just it was just absurd how much time it was taking to make the small changes and then it just watching it rebuild and then water turns off that cancel the build and then then do it cancel the build and then do it again and it's just I'm just driving out there to prove that I've done my due diligence a little bit and I did Google and look up different ways and what people are saying about how to audit or improve bill times and there just wasn't much and definitely nothing that's gonna get to the same performance level as next so yeah that's just all that kind of adds up to me and that time time to move on but it's been it's been a hell of a run and it's a great tool axle if anyone still working on it like I'm sure the lockers locker reasons to still stay with Gatsby
