## 2022 List of Hosting Solutions

This is a reference list of hosting options in 2022 prompted by the issues with the darling Heroku(Sales Force).

### TL:DR

#### Opinion

Recently Heroku(Sales Force) made many business decisions that have fractured the fragile relationship with the development community. In short two huge issues first the [security breach April 13](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2413) and how it was handled and the removal of the free tiers for ["Heroku's Next Chapert](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter). Any student, aspiring developer, maker, solopreneur, entrapener and small business owner knows development is expensive in time, effort, and tools and the payout is not always assured. The Freemium tools help these folks get started at whatever pace they are going.

I understand that their is without a double a lot of abuse of these tools but it is important to acknoledge that some people will always try to exploit a systems free or not. Business and we as a community need to decide if the cutting cost by reducing the launch pad(freemium) services is worth the lost relationships and growth from the apps that hit scale.

I think this is a very poor business decision but with many of the larger companies the true faly of these decisions take three to five years to manifesst.
