This article goes over solutions for managing multiple versions of Node.js on macOS. We'll start with a solution that I felt was straightforward and easily manageable. This is a living article and other solutions may be added over time. This solution was pulled from [How to manage multiple Node.js versions on macOS X - Notiz.dev](https://notiz.dev/blog/how-to-manage-multiple-node-versions-on-mac) and this article is meant as a public personal reference.

## Assumptions

- HomeBrew is installed
- general understanding of bash/zsh profiles

## Install Desired Node Versions

```sh
brew install node@<version>
```

**Example**

```sh
brew install node@16
```

> The default `brew install node` installed the latest version

### Useful CLI commands to check work

Check node version

```sh
node --version
```

Check node install location

```sh
which node
```

### Use Alsias to switch Node versions

Add and alias to `.zshrc` for each Node version installed.

_Copy the following to .zshrc_

```sh title=.zshrc
alias node16='export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@16/bin:$PATH"'
alias node14='export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@14/bin:$PATH"'
```

or from terminal

```sh
echo -n alias node13='export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@16/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo -n alias node13='export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@14/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

> Refernece alias in CLI to switch between node versions

**Example**

```sh
 node16
 node -v # v16.11.0
```

> ðŸ“” This solution only changes the Node version in the terminal instance
