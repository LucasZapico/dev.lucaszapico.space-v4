There are many reasons you might want to push code via ssh but under different identities or profiles.  

## TLDR 

Easily pushing up changes to one of the many git solutions is an essential part of any workflow and not likely to change anytime soon. Setting up ssh between local env and github, bitbucket etc is one of the first things we figure out on the developer journey. There may come a time when you don't have a separate machine setup for work or maybe you want to be able to push some code from your personal machine. Or you have a open source profile seperate from your professional profile. 

## Create ssh key pairs for each service or machine

Navigate to `~/.ssh` and generate a new private, public key pair.  

```sh 
ssh-keygen -t rsa 
```

You will be prompted to name the file, the convention that makes the most sense for me is `<identifier>.<domain>.key` for example `personal.github.key` or `organization.domain.key`. 

### Associate Domain, host with key 

Navigate to `~/.ssh/config`, if the file does not exist make it or open it in your favorite text editor. Add a config for each account. 

```txt:title=config 
...
##
## GITHUB
##
## Github Personal 
Host personal.github.com 
    HostName github.com
    User git
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal.github.key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
## Github <some-organization>
Host <organization>.github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<organization>.github.key
...
```

## Add a custom domain to the local git repo config 

When you `git init` a repo it creates a `./.git/` in this we can  


```txt 
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@lucaszapico.github.com:LucasZapico/.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[pull]
	rebase = true

```



## Example of my ssh config 

Note the ip's are faked.  

```txt:title=config 
##
## GITHUB
##
## Github Personal 
Host personal.github.com 
    HostName github.com
    User git
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal.github.key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
## Github <some-organization>
Host <organization>.github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<organization>.github.key
## Vultr Admin
Host Vultr.com
    HostName <host-ip>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal.vultr.key 
##
## LOCAL NETWORK MACHINES
##
Host 198.152.0.10
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/machine1.local.key
# proxmox 
Host 198.152.1.341
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/host.prox1.key
# Fig ssh integration. Keep at the bottom of this file.
Match all
  Include ~/.fig/ssh

##
## REFERENCE
##
# Make new key pair
# `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
# `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
#
#

```


#### Test Connections 

```sh 
ssh -T git@personal.github.com
```
