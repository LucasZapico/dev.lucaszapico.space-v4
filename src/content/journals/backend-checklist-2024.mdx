## Introduction 

This is just a general journal for patterns to check for when building out a new backend service. I have found that some of the starters that come with things like Auth out of the box don't always have patterns like "check if email is unique". So this is a little reference for myself to make sure I check that the starter or framework has the functionality I expect.

## Catch

- check email uniqueness
- check password strength
- check for password reset
- check for email verification
- check for user roles
