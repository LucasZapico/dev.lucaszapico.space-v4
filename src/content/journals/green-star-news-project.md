## About

The objective of this project was to an exercise exploring various news API's and to explore the various design patterns for calling said APIs in Gatsby. The API's explored were Bloomberg, NewsAPI, Financial Times and RapidAPI. A retroactive note on the project was that the API's I explored did not give you article content in the Developer or Freemium versions. Because of this the work on the experience of the project was called.
