## User Stories 

###  Local and Public Network Human Readable and Rememberable Domain Names

As a user, I don't want to have to remember or look up ip addresses to get to the service I want to useCallback. I want to be able to type a domain name into my browser and have it resolve to the correct ip address.

### Service Health Monitoring

As a maintainer, I want to be able to see the health of my service at a single point and to get notifications if a service goes down.

As a maintainer, I want a clear logging solution to debug issues with my services.

## Server Env 

## Challenges 

- I want to set up a local dns so that I don't need to look up ip's each time I want to get into the various Proxmox machines I have running.

### Local DNS 

Trom my research their seem to be two options.
