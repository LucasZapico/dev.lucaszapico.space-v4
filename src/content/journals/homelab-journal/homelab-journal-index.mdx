## Introduction 

I have been hacking on homelabs for a while now, more than a year less than five. This living journal is little catch for some of the things I have learned and done.

### Brief summary of my current setup


- 2015 Macbook pro running Proxmox 
  - 6T of storage RAID 4 managed with TrueNas 
  - ubuntu server 

## Server Env 



## Challenges 

- I want to set up a local dns so that I don't need to look up ip's each time I want to get into the various Proxmox machines I have running.

### Local DNS 

Trom my research their seem to be two options. 

- [Pi-hle](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole)
- [Adguard dns](https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html)
- [Unbound](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)
- [Dnsmasq](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)
- [Bind](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)
- [CoreDNS](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)
- [Knot](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)
- [PowerDNS](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)
