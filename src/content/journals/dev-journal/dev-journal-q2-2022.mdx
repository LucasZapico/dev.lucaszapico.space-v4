# Development Journal Q2 2022

## Logs and Infinite Reload with Nodemon

I recently evolved as a developer with a new level of understanding of a strong logging infrastructure. In a recent node express API I set up a `morgan`, `winston` logging architecture and was overjoyed by what it did to my debugging process. But after I really started using it my development app handled by Nodemon kept refreshing continuously. At the time I had also implemented a absolute path package `module-alias` and initially thought that the continuos refresh was due to that. But as I dug deeper into the challenge I finally discoverd it was because `nodemon` was watching my log files.

I have never had any cause to configure a nodemon config as it has always just worked out of the box. But I finally ran into a use case.

```json
{
  "verbose": true,
  "ignore": ["*.test.js", "logs/*"]
}
```

In conclusion I just wanted to journalize this challenge as it was a bit of a gotcha for me and in journalizing it I hope to inforce the cercumstance.

I'm going to add this use case to my node express API reference notes in the hope that I don't spin on this challenge again.
