I have a database with tables; 

- `date`
- `day_hours`
- `logs`
- `users`
- `app_settings`

The data coming from the app is primary logs, the other tables are derived from logs and are there to enable efficient queries. My question is where the logic for association should exist? The two options I see are using sqlite triggers or I could handle the logic in the ts service. 

### Error handling
