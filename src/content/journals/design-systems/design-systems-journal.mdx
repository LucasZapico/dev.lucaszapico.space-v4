## Catch 

I want to throw done some thoughts on abstraction. As I have been hacking on making custom Typora themes. 

### Abstractions

Sizing and spacing should be constrained into a reasonable scale. Meaning a base "atom" the smallest commonly used space. 
 
Leaving our spacing options as `1px * x` allows for too much inconsistency in a design. We could argue that `rem` or `em` solves this. But in my opinion, constraining a little further strikes that best balance between unique, enjoyable, creative design while allowing for consistent visual experiences. 

#### Why does consistency matter in design

- consistency implies predictability
- predictability implies trust 
- trust is good for business and relationships in general
